                            UX Designer and software engineer
                        </strong>
                        currently living in The Hague, Netherlands. Before moving here I lived in Hungary, which is where I happened to grow up as well.

                        I consider myself a designer at heart, even if my projects aren't things you would generally consider design. I write code the way others create art: I am maximalistic with my creations, plan every step of the way and make sure whatever comes out the other side is something I can be proud of. I take code linting seriously, and keep myself accountable by hosting most of my important projects publically on Github, where it is forever open to scrutiny.

                        My current passion seems to be in interface design, specifically relating to the terminal emulator. Since vim, my text editor of choice resides in the terminal, I like to keep my other tools in the same place. At some point, I wanted to create my own terminal applications, but realized how archaic most of the libraries to do so were at the time I decided to make my own. After many hours of coding, debugging and learning all the weird and totally logical and sensible APIs the terminal provides, I have come up with a pretty nifty project, which you can check out

                        I also create websites sometimes! This website was generated using a fancy template engine I wrote in Python, and has some siblings around the web. I designed and co-wrote a parcel pickup point locator website with a friend of mine at the request of a fairly large Hungarian company, which you can test out
