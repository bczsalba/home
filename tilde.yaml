          My name is Balazs Cene, and I am a <strong>UX Designer and software engineer</strong>
          currently living in The Hague, Netherlands. Before moving here I lived in Hungary, which
          is where I happened to grow up as well.
          <br><br>

          I consider myself a designer at heart, even if my projects aren't things you would
          generally consider design. I write code the way others create art: I am maximalistic
          with my creations, plan every step of the way and make sure whatever comes out the
          other side is something I can be proud of. I take code linting seriously, and keep myself
          accountable by hosting most of my important projects publically on Github, where it is
          forever open to scrutiny.

          <br><br>
          My current passion seems to be in interface design, specifically relating to the terminal
          emulator. Since vim, my text editor of choice resides in the terminal, I like to keep my
          other tools in the same place. At some point, I wanted to create my own terminal applications,
          but realized how archaic most of the libraries to do so were at the time I decided to
          make my own. After many hours of coding, debugging and learning all the weird and totally
          logical and sensible APIs the terminal provides, I have come up with a pretty nifty project,
          which you can check out <a href='https://github.com/bczsalba/pytermgui'>here</a>. At the time
          of writing it is nearing its 1.0.0 release, and has 210+ stars on Github.

          <br><br>
          I also create websites sometimes! This website was generated using a fancy template engine I
          wrote in Python, and has some siblings around the web. I designed and co-wrote a parcel pickup
          point locator website with a friend of mine at the request of a fairly large Hungarian company,
          which you can test out <a href='https://ppp-finder.gkidigital.hu/'>here</a>. It unfortunately
          didn't end up being used by them because of the fees Google Maps takes to embed on a website,
          but I'm still very proud of what we achieved.

          <br><br>
          You can find my contacts below. I'm most reachable through email, but other methods should work
          as well.

          Thank you for stopping by, and may you have an amazing day!
